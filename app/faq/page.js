          "Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of money that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the US dollar or euro), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, typically based on blockchain technology. Bitcoin, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most well-known. Today, there are over 10,000 cryptocurrencies, with a total market cap exceeding $3 trillion as of March 29, 2025. Cryptocurrencies enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, offering benefits like transparency, security, and global accessibility, but they also come with risks like volatility and regulatory uncertainty.",
