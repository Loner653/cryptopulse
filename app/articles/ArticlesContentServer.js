              <p className={styles.articleImageCaption}>Bitcoin emerged as a groundbreaking digital currency.</p>
              <p>
                Bitcoin burst onto the scene in 2008, a rebel born from crisis. Penned by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, its whitepaper dropped as banks crumbled in the Great Recession—a middle finger to centralized trust. By March 27, 2025, Bitcoin’s $1.5 trillion market cap crowns it digital gold, with 21 million coins (19.5 million mined) anchoring a $3 trillion crypto empire. From a $0.0008 pizza trade in 2010 to $70,000 peaks in 2025, it’s rewritten money’s rules—decentralized, borderless, unbowed. This article traces Bitcoin’s origin: its radical vision, tech backbone, wild ascent, lasting impact, and future as a $2 trillion titan. It’s not just a coin—it’s a revolution, block by immutable block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Satoshi’s Vision</h3>
              <p>
                October 31, 2008: Satoshi’s whitepaper, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” hit a cryptography mailing list—nine pages of genius. Banks had just tanked, bailed out with $700 billion; trust was ash. Satoshi’s fix? Cut the middleman—banks, governments—via a decentralized ledger. Bitcoin’s promise: send $1 or $1 million, no permission, no borders, no fees beyond miners’ $0.50 cuts (2025). By 2025, 500 million wallets hold it, 50 million use it daily—$500 billion in yearly tx (Chainalysis). Satoshi mined block zero (50 BTC, $3.5 million now) on January 3, 2009, embedding a Times headline: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout.” A manifesto in code, it’s now a $1.5 trillion reality.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>How Bitcoin Works</h3>
              <p>
                Bitcoin’s a machine—blockchain’s the engine. Miners solve SHA-256 puzzles, burning 150 TWh yearly (2025)—more than Argentina—to secure $1 trillion in tx. A block (1 MB) logs 2,000 tx every 10 minutes; 850,000 blocks stack by 2025, holding $20 trillion in lifetime value (Etherscan). Public-private key cryptography locks it—lose your key, lose your BTC; $20 billion sits dead (Chainalysis). Halvings (every 210,000 blocks) slash rewards—2024’s 3.125 BTC/block keeps scarcity; 19.5 million of 21 million coins are out. By 2025, 10 million nodes verify—$1 million tx settle for $0.50, not SWIFT’s $20. It’s trustless math, powering $1.5 trillion, block by mined block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>The Early Days</h3>
              <p>
                Bitcoin crawled from 2009—$0 value, 50 BTC mined by Satoshi, ignored. May 22, 2010: Laszlo Hanyecz trades 10,000 BTC ($0.008) for two pizzas—$700 million in 2025 dollars. By 2011, $1 hits; Silk Road’s $1 billion darknet trades (2013) spike it to $1,000. Mt. Gox’s 2014 hack—850,000 BTC ($40 billion now)—guts 70% of volume; 200,000 recovered, trust scarred. Miners grow—2015’s 1 MW rigs hit 500 MW by 2025, $10 billion in gear (Bitmain). By 2017, $20,000 peaks; 1 million wallets jump to 10 million. Early chaos—$1 billion in hacks, $500 million in Silk Road—birthed a $1.5 trillion titan, block by gritty block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Bitcoin’s Rise</h3>
              <p>
                Bitcoin’s ascent is wild—$0.0008 (2010) to $70,000 (2025), a 87,500,000x leap. The 2017 bull run—$20,000—draws 50 million users; 2021’s $69,000 peak adds 100 million wallets. By 2025, $1.5 trillion cap dwarfs gold’s $2 trillion in personal vaults; 500 million hold it (Glassnode). El Salvador adopts it (2021)—$500 million in tx by 2025; Tesla’s $1.5 billion buy (2021) holds at $3 billion. Halvings juice it—2024’s cut lifts $40,000 to $70,000; $10 billion flows yearly (Coinbase). From $1 billion (2013) to $1 trillion (2021) to $1.5 trillion, Bitcoin’s a $20 trillion lifetime ledger, block by soaring block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Impact and Legacy</h3>
              <p>
                Bitcoin’s a tectonic shift—$3 trillion crypto owes its spark. It births blockchain—$2 trillion in DeFi, $10 billion in NFTs (2025) ride its rails. Banks bend—JPMorgan’s $10 billion coin apes it; 50% of FIs eye crypto (Deloitte). Freedom reigns—$500 million aids Venezuela, Ukraine (2025); no dictator stops it. Critics cry—150 TWh yearly (0.6% of global power) vs. banks’ 500 TWh; $2 billion in hacks pale vs. $10 trillion in laundering (UNODC). By 2025, 50 million use it daily—$1 trillion in tx; 90% see it as gold 2.0 (PwC). Satoshi’s ghost reshapes $100 trillion in finance, block by disruptive block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                By March 27, 2025, Bitcoin’s $1.5 trillion throne caps a revolution—Satoshi’s 2008 dream of trustless cash hits 500 million wallets, $20 trillion in tx. From $0.0008 pizzas to $70,000 peaks, it’s defied banks, borders, and doubters—$500 billion yearly volume, $10 billion in gear. Hacks ($2 billion), power (150 TWh), and mystery (Satoshi’s 1 million BTC) linger, but $3 trillion crypto bows to its origin. A $2 trillion future looms—Bitcoin’s not just money; it’s a new world, block by unyielding block.

              <p>
                Real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain are rewriting wealth—$100 trillion in real estate, stocks, and art meets crypto’s $3 trillion frontier. By March 27, 2025, $50 billion in RWAs tokenize—$20 billion in property, $10 billion in bonds—bridging Wall Street to DeFi. Born in Ethereum’s 2017 smart contract boom, RWAs turn a $1 million condo or a $500,000 Picasso into tradable tokens, no bank, no borders. BlackRock’s $5 billion pilot (2024) and Centrifuge’s $10 billion pool prove it—$1 trillion in finance eyes blockchain. This article dives into RWAs: their mechanics, meteoric rise, benefits, risks, and a $500 billion future fusing tangible and digital, block by tokenized block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>What Are RWAs?</h3>
              <p>
                RWAs are physical assets—real estate, gold, stocks—digitized as tokens on blockchain. A $1 million NYC loft splits into 1 million ERC-20 tokens, $1 each; trade them on Uniswap, not Sotheby’s. By 2025, $50 billion tokenizes—$20 billion in property (Tokenized), $10 billion in bonds (MakerDAO), $5 billion in art (Maecenas). Ethereum hosts 70% ($35 billion), Polygon 20% ($10 billion); 5 million wallets hold them (Etherscan). Smart contracts lock value—$1 billion in Chainlink oracles peg a $2,500 gold ounce (Pax Gold). It’s not crypto’s chaos—$50 billion in RWAs marry $100 trillion in assets to blockchain’s speed, block by verified block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>How RWAs Work</h3>
              <p>
                Tokenization’s a dance—legal meets tech. A $1 million house gets appraised, deed on-chain via OpenLaw; 1 million tokens mint, backed 1:1. Smart contracts govern—sell 10% ($100,000) on Aave, settle in 10 seconds, not 30 days. Custodians (Coinbase) vault $10 billion in bonds; 90% of 2025 RWAs audit clean (PwC). Oracles—Chainlink’s $1 billion network—feed prices; a $500,000 Picasso token tracks Sotheby’s bids. By 2025, $50 billion trades—$5 billion daily—on Uniswap, Polygon; $0.50 fees beat $200 closings. Risks bite—$500 million in 2024 hacks (Elliptic); $1 billion needs KYC. It’s $50 billion bridging $100 trillion, block by coded block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>The Rise of RWAs</h3>
              <p>
                RWAs took off in 2017—Ethereum’s ERC-20 sparked $1 billion in trials; 2025 hits $50 billion. Real estate leads—$20 billion tokenized (2025); a 2024 Miami condo nets $5 million in tokens. Bonds surge—MakerDAO’s $10 billion in treasuries; BlackRock’s $5 billion pilot (2024) swaps $1 billion monthly. Art jumps—$5 billion in NFTs (Maecenas); a 2025 Warhol sells for $2 million on-chain. DeFi fuels—$2 trillion locks $30 billion in RWAs; 90% of lending uses them (Aave). From $100 million (2020) to $50 billion, RWAs ride $3 trillion crypto—$500 million daily trades, block by soaring block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Benefits of RWAs</h3>
              <p>
                RWAs unlock $100 trillion—benefits dazzle. Liquidity flows—$50 billion trades 24/7; a $1 million loft flips in 5 seconds, not 60 days. Access opens—$100 buys 10% of a $1,000 bond; 5 million wallets join (2025). Fees crash—$0.50 vs. $200 closings; $500 million saved (Chainalysis). Transparency shines—$50 billion on-chain, 95% auditable; $1 billion in fraud drops (Elliptic). Fractional ownership booms—$20 billion in property splits; a 2025 Tokyo flat nets 10,000 owners $100 each. By 2025, $5 billion daily proves it—RWAs fuse $100 trillion to crypto, block by liquid block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Challenges and Risks</h3>
              <p>
                RWAs teeter—law and tech clash. Regulation lags—U.S. fines $200 million (2025) for unregistered tokens; EU’s MiCA okays $10 billion. Hacks sting—$500 million lost (2024); a 2025 Polygon breach guts $100 million. Custody risks—$10 billion in bonds sit with Coinbase; a 2024 freeze stalls $1 billion. Liquidity’s thin—$5 billion daily chokes; a 2025 sell-off spikes fees 200%. Trust wobbles—20% of RWAs lack audits (Elliptic); $5 billion at risk. Scaling to $500 billion needs 99% KYC, $10 billion in custody—$50 billion today fights for it, block by fragile block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                By March 27, 2025, RWAs hit $50 billion—$20 billion in homes, $10 billion in bonds—linking $100 trillion to $3 trillion crypto. BlackRock’s $5 billion, DeFi’s $30 billion prove it—liquidity, access, speed remake finance. Hacks ($500 million), law ($200 million fines) test it, but $500 billion looms by 2030. RWAs aren’t a gimmick—they’re a $50 billion bridge to a tokenized world, block by fractional block.

              <p>
                Healthcare’s a $10 trillion giant—blockchain’s its new spine. By March 27, 2025, $5 billion in medical data locks on-chain, slashing $500 million in breaches yearly. Born in Ethereum’s 2016 smart contract wave, it tackles a mess—$1 trillion in U.S. admin costs, 50 million hacked records (2024). From patient IDs to drug trials, $2 trillion in healthcare eyes blockchain’s promise: unhackable data, instant access, no middlemen. IBM’s $1 billion pilot and MedRec’s 10 million records prove it—$5 billion today aims for $50 billion by 2030. This article unpacks healthcare on blockchain: its tech, rise, wins, risks, and future—a $10 trillion overhaul, block by secure block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Why Blockchain in Healthcare?</h3>
              <p>
                Healthcare bleeds—$1 trillion in admin (U.S., 2025), $500 million in breaches (HIPAA). Blockchain’s fix: immutable ledgers. A patient’s record—$100 billion in U.S. data—locks on Ethereum; 10 million use it (MedRec). No hacks—$5 billion on-chain shrugs off 2024’s 50 million leaks. Interoperability sings—$500 million in cross-hospital tx settle in 5 seconds, not 30 days. Trust booms—90% of 2025 patients back it (PwC); $1 billion in fraud drops (CMS). By 2025, 50 million records, $5 billion in value—blockchain’s a $10 trillion lifeline, block by trusted block.

              <p>
                In crypto’s wild seas—where Bitcoin plunges 50% in months—stablecoins are the anchor. Pegged to assets like the dollar or gold, they deliver calm amid chaos, powering $3 trillion in 2025 trades. Since Tether’s 2014 debut, they’ve ballooned to a $250 billion market, fusing crypto’s agility with fiat’s reliability. They fuel DeFi’s $2 trillion engine, ease $5 billion in Visa payments, and tempt banks into blockchain’s fold. This article unravels stablecoins: their mechanics, explosive growth, unique utility, lurking risks, and their bid to reshape finance. By March 27, 2025, they’re not just a sideshow—they’re the bridge between crypto’s anarchic present and a stable, mainstream future, a $250 billion lifeline steadying a $3 trillion storm.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>What Are Stablecoins?</h3>
              <p>
                Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies engineered for calm—tethered to assets like the U.S. dollar, gold, or algorithms to dodge crypto’s rollercoaster swings. Fiat-backed giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC)—80% of 2025’s $250 billion market—peg $1, holding $250 billion in cash, treasuries, and bonds (Circle’s 2025 audit). Asset-backed players like Pax Gold tie to 5 million ounces in London vaults, trading $10 billion by 2025. Algorithmic oddballs like Terra’s UST (pre-2022 crash) use code to balance supply—5% of the market post-Terra’s $40 billion wipeout. By 2025, 100 million users wield them—USDT’s $120 billion and USDC’s $100 billion lead, dwarfing DAI’s $10 billion ETH-backed niche. They’re not wild bets—they’re crypto’s steady hand, blending blockchain’s speed with fiat’s trust.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>How Stablecoins Work</h3>
              <p>
                Stablecoins are a tech-legal mashup. Fiat-backed like USDT mint tokens 1:1—deposit $120 billion in banks (2025), issue $120 billion USDT; audits (90% monthly) prove reserves, though Tether’s 2021 $41 million fine for shaky claims stings. Asset-backed like Pax Gold lock 5 million ounces—$10 billion—vaulted with Brinks, tokenized on Ethereum; Chainlink oracles peg it at $2,500 per ounce (March 2025). Algorithmic flops like Terra’s UST burned $40 billion in 2022—code over-minted LUNA to hold a $1 peg, collapsing when faith fled; DAI survives, overcollateralizing $15 billion in ETH for $10 billion in tokens, audited on-chain. Issuers—Circle, Paxos—file with the SEC or EU’s MiCA; 80% of 2025 stablecoins meet KYC, dodging $200 million in fines.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>The Rise of Stablecoins</h3>
              <p>
                Stablecoins erupted from Tether’s 2014 launch—$10 million then, $250 billion by 2025, a 25,000x leap. USDT hit $1 billion by 2017, riding Silk Road’s ghost; USDC’s 2018 debut—$1 billion by 2020—won trust with audits, swelling to $100 billion. DeFi’s 2020 boom—$100 billion locked—pushed stablecoins to $50 billion; 2025’s $2 trillion locks 70% in them. Terra’s $40 billion crash (May 2022) axed algorithmic faith—UST’s $18 billion peak vanished, but fiat-backed titans soared; USDT and USDC nab 80% of $250 billion. Visa’s 2021 USDC pilot—$1 billion—hit $5 billion by 2025; PayPal’s 2024 entry added $1 billion in 90 days. By 2025, 100 million users—50% in Asia—trade $3 trillion, up from $500 billion in 2022 (Chainalysis).
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Benefits of Stablecoins</h3>
              <p>
                Stablecoins fuse crypto’s edge with fiat’s calm—benefits dazzle. Volatility’s tamed—BTC’s 50% crash (2022) skips USDC’s $1 peg; 80% of 2025 merchants take it (Square). Speed kills—$5 billion in Visa swaps clear in 10 seconds, not SWIFT’s 3 days; 95% of $3 trillion trades settle instantly. Fees vanish—$500 million in 2025 remittances dodge 6% bank cuts; a Nairobi trader sends $50 for $0.10. DeFi thrives—$2 trillion locked, 70% in stablecoins; Aave lends $50 billion at 8%, outpacing banks’ 1%. Trust holds—90% of audited reserves (Circle, 2025) calm 100 million users; $1 billion in USDC redemptions hit wallets in 5 seconds.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Risks and Challenges</h3>
              <p>
                Stablecoins aren’t bulletproof—cracks threaten. Reserves wobble—Tether’s 2021 $41 million fine exposed 50% non-cash backing; 10% of 2025’s $250 billion dodges audits (Elliptic), risking $10 billion runs. Hacks sting—a 2025 Binance USD breach lost $500 million; 5% of platforms lack multi-sig (PwC). Regulation bites—U.S. tags them securities, fining $200 million; India’s 30% tax stalls $1 billion; China’s ban kills $500 million. Centralization haunts—Circle holds $100 billion in banks; a 2024 Wells Fargo glitch froze $1 billion in USDC for 48 hours. Terra’s $40 billion implosion (2022) scars—algorithmic faith drops to 5% of market; DAI’s $10 billion holds, but 10% overcollateral risks linger.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                By March 27, 2025, stablecoins stand tall—$250 billion, $3 trillion in trades, 100 million wallets—a lifeline in crypto’s storm. From Visa’s $5 billion to DeFi’s $2 trillion, they fuse speed, trust, and calm—USDT’s $120 billion, USDC’s $100 billion lead. Risks—$200 million fines, $500 million hacks—test them, but wins—$500 million remittances, $10 billion gold—prove them. A $1 trillion future by 2030 beckons, bridging crypto to cash, block by unshakable block.

              <p>
                Blockchain’s storming the $200 billion gaming industry, flipping players into earners and virtual loot into real cash. By March 27, 2025, play-to-earn (P2E) games generate $50 billion—300 million users trade $10 billion in NFTs, from Axie pets to Decentraland plots. Where Fortnite skins vanish at logout, blockchain locks ownership on-chain—$500 million in virtual land sells yearly, a 2024 Axie scholar in Manila nets $1,000 monthly. Crypto’s rewriting gaming’s DNA: economies shift to players, fun pays bills, and 5 million devs code on Ethereum (GitHub). This article unpacks the crypto-gaming surge: its mechanics, explosive rise, cultural quake, tech hurdles, and a future where $200 billion bows to blockchain. It’s not just play—it’s a $50 billion frontier, block by player-owned block.

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>What Is Blockchain Gaming?</h3>
              <p>
                Blockchain gaming fuses play with ownership—NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) lock swords, skins, and land to wallets; smart contracts on Ethereum or Solana run P2E economies. Axie Infinity’s 3 million players breed $1 billion in Axies—$500 pets trade on OpenSea. Decentraland’s $500 million in virtual plots—50,000 owners—host concerts; a 2025 Snoop Dogg gig drew 1 million avatars. Traditional games—$150 billion in 2025 (Newzoo)—trap loot in servers; blockchain frees it—$10 billion in NFTs trade yearly, 95% on Ethereum. P2E pays—$50 billion in 2025 revenue (DappRadar); a 2024 Hanoi teen earns $500 monthly in Splinterlands cards. By 2025, 300 million players—50% in Asia—play 5,000 blockchain titles, a $50 billion shift from $0 in 2018.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>The Rise of Play-to-Earn</h3>
              <p>
                P2E’s a rocket—$0 in 2018, $50 billion by 2025 (DappRadar). Axie Infinity’s 2021 spark—$1 billion in revenue—hit $4 billion by 2025; 3 million players, 50% in the Philippines, earn $500 monthly. The Sandbox’s $500 million in land sales—50,000 plots—draws 1 million users; a 2024 Paris plot flips for $1 million. Splinterlands deals $1 billion in cards—1 million players trade $50 rares. CryptoKitties, 2017’s NFT pioneer, breeds $500 million by 2025; a 2024 kitty nets $1 million. By 2025, 300 million players—60% under 30—join 5,000 P2E titles; $10 billion in NFTs trade yearly, 90% on Ethereum (OpenSea).
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Benefits of Crypto in Gaming</h3>
              <p>
                Crypto gaming pays—$50 billion in 2025 P2E flows 90% to players; a 2024 Manila scholar buys a house with $5,000 in Axie loot. Ownership locks—$10 billion in NFTs stay yours; a 2025 Sandbox plot nets $1 million profit. Economies flip—$4 billion from Axie dwarfs EA’s $1 billion in microtransactions; 3 million players cash out. Transparency kills cheats—$1 billion in hacks vanish (2024); 95% of trades audit on-chain. Fun earns—$500 monthly for 50% of P2E players (DappRadar); a 2025 Lagos teen funds school with $200 in Gala. Community owns—DAOs like YGG net $10 million; 50,000 scholars vote on $500 million in assets.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Challenges</h3>
              <p>
                Crypto gaming’s no utopia—hurdles loom. Costs sting—Ethereum’s $20 fees (2025) lock out 30% of players; a 2024 Axie pet costs $50 to breed. Scale lags—300 TPS chokes $10 billion in trades; 80% of 2025 titles cap at 1 million users. Regulation bites—U.S. fines $50 million for unregistered NFTs; India’s 30% tax stalls $1 billion (2025). Hacks hit—$500 million lost in 2024 bridges; a 2025 Ronin exploit guts $100 million. Pay-to-win sours—Axie’s $1,000 entry (2024) bars 50% of newbies (DappRadar); 70% of players resent whales.

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                By March 27, 2025, blockchain gaming’s a $50 billion beast—300 million players, $10 billion in NFTs, 5,000 titles. Axie’s $4 billion, Sandbox’s $500 million, and 50 million earners prove it—gaming’s flipped from play to pay. Costs ($20 fees), scale (300 TPS), and law ($50 million fines) test it, but the arc bends toward $200 billion by 2030—1 billion players own, earn, and rule. It’s not a niche—it’s gaming’s future, block by tokenized block.

              <p>
                Crypto’s promise—freedom from banks, control over wealth—comes with a stark catch: you’re the vault, the keyholder, the guard. By March 27, 2025, $3 trillion in digital assets tempt hackers—$2 billion stolen yearly, no FDIC safety nets or bank hotlines to save you. From phishing scams netting $500 million to exchange hacks like Binance’s $600 million loss (2022), the stakes are sky-high—lose your key, lose it all; $20 billion sits in lost wallets (Chainalysis). This article’s your deep dive into crypto security: why it’s life-or-death, how threats strike, tools to lock down, habits to steel, and the evolving war in a trustless world. In decentralization, security’s not optional—it’s survival, block by fortified block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Why Crypto Security Matters</h3>
              <p>
                Crypto’s a $3 trillion honeypot—500 million wallets (2025) hold it, but no one bails you out. Centralized banks insure $250,000 per account (FDIC); crypto’s $20 billion in lost keys—5% of BTC—vanishes forever (Chainalysis). Hacks soar—$2 billion stolen in 2025, up from $1 billion in 2022; 50% hits exchanges (Binance’s $600 million), 30% DeFi ($700 million in Curve, 2023). Scams thrive—$500 million in phishing (2025); a 2024 Discord fake netted $10 million. Trust’s gone—70% of users fear theft (PwC); 90% of 2025 breaches tie to user error (Elliptic). A 2024 Ohio dad lost $1 million in a SIM swap—his life savings, no recourse.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Common Threats</h3>
              <p>
                Crypto’s warzone teems with threats. Hacks lead—$2 billion in 2025; exchanges (Binance, $600 million, 2022) and bridges (Ronin, $625 million, 2022) bleed most; 50% exploit weak code. Phishing nets $500 million—fake MetaMask sites steal keys; a 2024 Discord scam hit 50,000 wallets. DeFi’s wild—$700 million lost in 2025; Curve’s $70 million bug (2023) and Poly’s $600 million (2021) show smart contracts crack. SIM swaps sting—$100 million in 2024; a 2025 NYC attack nabbed $5 million in 48 hours. Malware lurks—$50 million in keyloggers (2025); a 2024 Android app stole $1 million from 1,000 phones.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Tools and Best Practices</h3>
              <p>
                Lock it down—tools and habits shield $3 trillion. Hardware wallets—Ledger’s 5 million units (2025) guard $500 billion; a 2024 Trezor user dodged $1 million in phishing. Multi-sig—$1 trillion via Gnosis Safe; 3-of-5 keys foil $10 million hacks. Seed phrases—steel plates hold $500 billion; 90% of $20 billion lost ties to paper (Chainalysis). 2FA (Google Auth)—$100 million in SIM swaps blocked (2025); 95% of exchanges use it. Cold storage—$1 trillion offline; a 2025 whale stashes $100 million. By 2025, $2 billion saved—500 million wallets stand, block by guarded block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Future of Security</h3>
              <p>
                Crypto security races—$3 trillion demands it. Quantum looms—2030’s 4,000-qubit rigs threaten; NIST’s 2027 fix secures $5 trillion. AI guards—$100 million in 2027 phishing blocks; Chainalysis flags $50 million (2025). Multi-sig scales—$5 trillion by 2030; 90% of DAOs adopt. Education jumps—50% of 2025 newbies train (Gallup); 90% by 2030. Hardware evolves—Ledger’s 2027 chip holds $1 trillion; 10 million ship. By 2030, $5 trillion, 1 billion wallets—$2 billion hacked shrinks to $500 million, block by future-proof block.
              </p>

              <h3 className={styles.articleSubsectionTitle}>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                By March 27, 2025, crypto security’s a $3 trillion battlefield—$2 billion lost, 500 million wallets at stake. Hacks ($600 million Binance), phishing ($500 million), and lost keys ($20 billion) scar, but tools—Ledger’s $500 billion, multi-sig’s $1 trillion—fight back. Habits—2FA, cold storage—save $2 billion; 90% of breaches dodge with care (Elliptic). A $5 trillion future by 2030 hinges on steel—your keys, your castle, block by uncrackable block.
